# Script-Based CIG Command Helpers

## Task Reference
- **Task ID**: internal-2
- **Task URL**: Internal development task (no GitHub issue yet)
- **Parent Task**: Core CIG System
- **Branch**: feature/internal-2-script-based-command-helpers
- **Template Version**: 2.0
- **Migration**: v1.0 (git:migration-backup-20251213-233514) → v2.0

## Goal
Replace compound bash operations in CIG commands with encapsulated shell scripts to resolve permissions issues

## Success Criteria
- [x] All CIG commands execute without permission errors
- [x] Script-based architecture enables future extension
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility maintained with POSIX tools
- [x] Permissions simplified to single script directory pattern

## Original Estimate
**Effort**: 1 day
**Complexity**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Current CIG command structure, bash scripting knowledge

## Major Steps
1. **Design Script Architecture**: Create `.cig/scripts/command-helpers/` structure
2. **Implement Helper Scripts**: Convert compound operations to standalone scripts
3. **Update CIG Commands**: Replace bash context loading with script calls
4. **Update Permissions**: Simplify allowed-tools to `Bash(.cig/scripts/*)`
5. **Validate All Commands**: Test complete CIG workflow

## Dependencies
- Access to `.cig/` directory for script creation
- Understanding of current context loading patterns
- POSIX shell scripting compatibility requirements

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality exactly
- Scripts must work on both Linux and macOS
- Cannot break existing template system
- Must preserve fallback behaviour for missing directories

## Current Status
**Status**: Completed
**Next Action**: Feature ready for production use
**Blockers**: None

## Actual Results
- **Duration**: Completed in single session (as estimated - 1 day)
- **Architecture**: Successfully implemented script-based helper system with 5 self-documenting scripts
- **Permission Resolution**: Eliminated all compound bash operations, now using single `Bash(.cig/scripts/*)` pattern
- **Security Model**: Added integrity verification with 0500 permissions and SHA256 validation
- **Command Updates**: Updated 6 CIG commands to use script calls instead of compound operations
- **Documentation**: Updated main DESIGN.md with complete architectural changes

## Lessons Learned
- **Self-Documenting Names**: Script names like `cig-load-autoload-config` eliminate need for LLM documentation lookup
- **Compound Operation Resolution**: Encapsulating complex bash operations in scripts completely resolves Claude Code permission prompts
- **Security Through Simplicity**: 0500 permissions with remote repository verification provides robust integrity checking
- **Template Consistency**: Standard script frontmatter enables systematic maintenance and version tracking
