# {{description}} - Maintenance

## Task Reference
- **Task ID**: {{taskId}}
- **Task URL**: {{taskUrl}}
- **Parent Task**: {{parentTask}}
- **Branch**: {{branchName}}
- **Template Version**: 2.0

## Goal
Define ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and support requirements for {{description}}.

## Monitoring Requirements
### System Health
- **Uptime**: Target availability metrics (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
- **Performance**: Response time thresholds and alerts
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, storage limits and scaling triggers

### Application Metrics
- **Business KPIs**: Key performance indicators aligned with objectives
- **User Metrics**: Engagement, satisfaction, and adoption rates
- **Error Rates**: Acceptable error thresholds and trending analysis

### Alerting Rules
- **Critical**: Immediate response required (24/7 on-call escalation)
- **Warning**: Investigation within X hours (business hours support)
- **Info**: Regular monitoring and review (weekly/monthly analysis)

## Maintenance Tasks
### Regular Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated health checks and log review
- **Weekly**: Performance review, optimisation opportunities, security updates
- **Monthly**: Dependency updates, security patches, comprehensive health check
- **Quarterly**: Architecture review, capacity planning, cost optimisation

### Preventive Maintenance
- Database optimisation and cleanup (index rebuilding, query tuning)
- Log rotation and archival (retention policies, storage management)
- Security vulnerability scanning (dependency audits, penetration testing)
- Backup validation and disaster recovery testing

## Incident Response
### Common Issues
- **Issue 1**: Description, symptoms, and resolution
- **Issue 2**: Description, symptoms, and resolution
- **Issue 3**: Description, symptoms, and resolution

### Troubleshooting Guide
- **Symptom**: Description of problem or error
- **Diagnosis**: How to identify root cause (logs, metrics, tools)
- **Resolution**: Step-by-step fix procedure with verification steps

### Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1**: First responder actions and triage
- **Level 2**: Subject matter expert escalation criteria
- **Level 3**: Critical incident and emergency response

## Performance Optimisation
### Optimisation Areas
- Database query performance and indexing strategy
- Caching strategy effectiveness and hit rates
- Resource utilisation patterns and waste reduction

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling approach and rationale
- Auto-scaling triggers and thresholds configuration
- Capacity planning and growth projections

## Documentation
### Runbooks
- Operational procedures and standard workflows
- Emergency response procedures and contact information
- Regular maintenance checklists and automation scripts

### Knowledge Base
- Common issues and solutions (searchable repository)
- Performance tuning guides and best practices
- Architecture and design decision records

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational and validated
- [ ] Maintenance procedures documented and automated where possible
- [ ] Team trained on support and incident response procedures
- [ ] Performance consistently within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Incident response times meet SLA requirements

## Status
**Status**: Finished
**Next Action**: N/A (Maintenance phase completed)
**Blockers**: None

## Actual Results
*To be filled upon completion*

## Lessons Learned
