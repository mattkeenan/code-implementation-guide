# Migration Tools to Migrate v1.0 to v2.0 - Plan

## Task Reference
- **Task ID**: internal-4
- **Task URL**: N/A (internal task)
- **Parent Task**: N/A
- **Branch**: feature/4-migration-tools
- **Template Version**: 2.0

## Goal
Build migration tools and process to safely migrate existing v1.0 tasks to v2.0 hierarchical structure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Migration script successfully moves directories to v2.0 structure
- [ ] Migration script renames workflow files to lettered format (a-h)
- [ ] Migration script adds Template Version 2.0 to all files
- [ ] Validation script confirms all content preserved
- [ ] Rollback capability tested and confirmed working
- [ ] Migration guide documents step-by-step process
- [ ] All existing tasks (1-3) successfully migrated to v2.0

## Original Estimate
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Complexity**: Medium-High (data migration requires careful validation)
**Dependencies**: v2.0 hierarchical system implemented (task 3)

## Major Milestones
1. **Migration Strategy Designed**: Safe approach with rollback capability defined
2. **Migration Script Built**: Automated directory moves and file renames working
3. **Validation Tested**: Content preservation verified
4. **Task 3 Migrated**: First task successfully migrated as proof-of-concept
5. **All Tasks Migrated**: Tasks 1-2 and 4 successfully migrated to v2.0
6. **System Verified**: All v2.0 commands working with migrated tasks

## Risk Assessment
### High Priority Risks
- **Data Loss During Migration**: Directory moves or file renames could lose content
  - **Mitigation**: Git-based rollback, validation before and after, dry-run mode

- **Breaking Backward Compatibility**: Migration could break existing v1.0 tasks
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility layer, test thoroughly

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Migration Script Bugs**: Script errors could corrupt task structure
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing on copies, manual verification steps

## Dependencies
- v2.0 hierarchical workflow system (task 3) must be complete and committed
- Existing tasks must be in clean state (no uncommitted changes)
- Git repository must be available for rollback

## Constraints
- Must preserve all existing content and commit history
- Must be reversible (rollback capability required)
- Cannot break backward compatibility during migration period
- Must validate content integrity before and after

## Decomposition Check
Review these signals to determine if this task should be broken into subtasks:
- [ ] **Time**: Will this take >1 week? **No** - Estimated 3-4 days
- [ ] **People**: Does this need >2 people working on different parts? **No** - Single developer
- [ ] **Complexity**: Does this involve 3+ distinct concerns? **Yes** - Migration script, validation, rollback
- [ ] **Risk**: Are there high-risk components that need isolation? **Yes** - Data migration is high-risk
- [ ] **Independence**: Can parts be worked on separately? **Yes** - Script, validation, docs can be separate

**Analysis**: 3/5 signals triggered, but task is manageable. Could decompose into subtasks (4.1: script, 4.2: validation, 4.3: docs) but will proceed as single task for now.

## Status
**Status**: Finished
**Next Action**: N/A (Plan phase completed)
**Blockers**: None
