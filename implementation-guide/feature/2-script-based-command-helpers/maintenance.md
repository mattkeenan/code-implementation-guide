# Script-Based CIG Command Helpers - Maintenance

## Task Reference
- **Task ID**: internal-2
- **Task URL**: Internal development task (no GitHub issue yet)
- **Parent Task**: Core CIG System
- **Branch**: feature/internal-2-script-based-command-helpers

## Goal
Define ongoing maintenance and support requirements for script-based CIG command helpers.

## Monitoring Requirements
### System Health
- **Script Execution**: All helper scripts execute without errors
- **Performance**: Context loading within 1 second
- **Compatibility**: Functionality maintained across system updates

### Application Metrics
- **Command Success Rate**: 100% execution without permission errors
- **Context Loading Accuracy**: Output matches expected patterns
- **Fallback Behaviour**: Proper fallback messages when files missing

### Alerting Rules
- Critical: Any CIG command fails with permission error
- Warning: Script execution time > 2 seconds
- Info: Regular functionality verification

## Maintenance Tasks
### Regular Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Verify all CIG commands execute successfully
- **Monthly**: Test cross-platform compatibility
- **Quarterly**: Review script performance and optimisation

### Preventive Maintenance
- Script permission verification (executable but not writable)
- POSIX compliance checking with system updates
- Performance monitoring for context loading operations
- Backup verification of script functionality

## Common Issues
### Known Problems
- **Permission Changes**: Scripts lose executable permission
  - **Resolution**: `chmod +x .cig/scripts/command-helpers/*`
- **Path Issues**: Scripts not found due to working directory
  - **Resolution**: Use absolute paths in command files
- **POSIX Compatibility**: System updates break shell features
  - **Resolution**: Review and update script syntax

### Troubleshooting Guide
- **Symptom**: CIG commands fail with "command not found"
- **Diagnosis**: Check script permissions and paths
- **Resolution**: Verify scripts are executable and properly referenced

## Performance Considerations
### Optimisation Areas
- Script execution time for large directories
- Context loading efficiency
- File system access patterns

### Scaling Strategy
- Caching of frequently accessed information
- Parallel execution where appropriate
- Incremental context loading for large projects

## Documentation
### Runbooks
- Script creation and deployment procedures
- CIG command integration guidelines
- Cross-platform testing procedures

### Knowledge Base
- POSIX shell scripting best practices
- CIG system architecture decisions
- Troubleshooting common script issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All helper scripts maintain 100% uptime
- [ ] CIG commands execute without permission issues
- [ ] Documentation complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Team familiar with script maintenance procedures

## Current Status
