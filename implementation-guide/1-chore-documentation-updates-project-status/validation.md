# Documentation Updates - Validation

## Task Reference
- **Task ID**: internal-3
- **Task URL**: Internal development task (no GitHub issue yet)
- **Parent Task**: Core CIG System Maintenance
- **Branch**: chore/internal-3-documentation-updates-project-status
- **Template Version**: 2.0
- **Migration**: v1.0 (git:migration-backup-20251213-233514) → v2.0

## Goal
Validate that all documentation updates accurately represent the current system state and provide appropriate guidance.

## Validation Approach

### Content Accuracy Validation
1. **Command Completeness**: Verify all implemented CIG commands are documented
2. **Structure Accuracy**: Confirm project structure diagrams match actual filesystem
3. **Version Consistency**: Ensure version information is current and consistent
4. **Feature Representation**: Confirm documented features match implemented capabilities

### User Experience Validation
1. **New User Clarity**: Documentation should enable new users to understand and use the system
2. **Beta Status Clarity**: Users should understand the development status and exercise appropriate caution
3. **Contribution Guidance**: Clear guidance on how to contribute and copyright assignment preferences

### Technical Validation
1. **Link Verification**: Ensure all internal links work correctly
2. **Command Examples**: Verify command syntax examples are accurate
3. **Configuration Examples**: Confirm configuration file examples are valid

## Validation Checklist

### README.md Validation
- [x] All current CIG commands listed with correct syntax
- [x] Project structure diagram matches actual `.cig/` and `implementation-guide/` layout
- [x] Version information explains git-based versioning approach
- [x] Project status section clearly communicates beta status
- [x] Contribution guidelines mention copyright assignment preference
- [x] Installation instructions remain accurate

### CLAUDE.md Validation
- [x] No longer contains "empty repository" placeholder text
- [x] Accurately describes current CIG system capabilities
- [x] Lists all available commands
- [x] Describes architecture accurately (script-based helpers, security model)
- [x] References correct file paths and system integration

### COMMANDS.md Validation
- [x] Includes `/cig-security-check` command documentation
- [x] All command descriptions match actual command behavior
- [x] Examples use correct syntax and parameters

### Version Information Validation
- [x] No references to outdated version numbers (like "1.0.0")
- [x] Git-based versioning approach explained clearly
- [x] Configuration examples use current version format

### Cross-File Consistency
- [x] Command lists consistent across README.md and COMMANDS.md
- [x] Project structure consistent between README.md and CLAUDE.md
- [x] Version information consistent across all files

## Testing Method
1. **Fresh Reader Test**: Have someone unfamiliar with the project read the documentation
2. **Command Execution**: Verify documented commands work as described
3. **Installation Test**: Follow installation instructions on clean system
4. **Link Testing**: Check all internal documentation links

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation enables new users to successfully set up and use CIG system
- Beta status is clearly communicated without discouraging legitimate use
- All implemented features are documented accurately
- No placeholder or outdated content remains
- Contribution process is clear and welcoming

## Current Status
**Status**: Completed
**Next Action**: N/A - Validation complete
**Blockers**: None

## Actual Results
All validation criteria met:
- README.md: All current commands documented with `/cig-security-check` added, project structure accurate, version information updated, beta status and contribution guidelines added
- CLAUDE.md: Placeholder content replaced with operational status, complete command list, accurate architecture description
- COMMANDS.md: Security check command documented with full details
- Cross-file consistency: All files now consistent in command lists, structure diagrams, and version information
- Git commit: aaf76a1 confirms all documentation updates applied successfully

Validation passed - documentation accurately represents current system state and provides clear guidance for users.

## Lessons Learned
- Systematic validation checklist ensures thorough coverage
- Cross-file consistency is critical for user trust
- Beta status messaging requires balance between caution and confidence
- Template file organisation required clarification during implementation
