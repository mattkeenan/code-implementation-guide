## Task Reference
- **Task ID**: CIG-BUGFIX-001
- **Task URL**: Internal bugfix task
- **Parent Task**: Core CIG System
- **Branch**: bugfix/CIG-BUGFIX-001-cig-command-permissions

## Goal
Deploy CIG Command Permissions Issue fix safely with minimal risk and maximum monitoring.

## Deployment Strategy
### Release Approach
- **Priority**: High - blocks all CIG functionality
- **Timing**: Immediate - critical system functionality
- **Method**: Direct commit to main branch (internal development)

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] All tests passing (command execution, context loading)
- [ ] Manual testing of each CIG command completed
- [ ] Fallback behaviour verified
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Deployment Steps
### Step 1: Final Validation
- [ ] Execute all CIG commands in test environment
- [ ] Verify context loading works correctly
- [ ] Confirm fallback messages appear appropriately

### Step 2: Deploy Changes
- [ ] Commit changes to `.claude/commands/` files
- [ ] Update implementation guide with completion status
- [ ] Tag release if appropriate

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test CIG commands in production environment
- [ ] Verify no permission errors occur
- [ ] Confirm all functionality restored

## Rollback Plan
- **Trigger**: Commands still fail or new errors introduced
- **Action**: Revert changes to `.claude/commands/` files
- **Recovery Time**: Immediate (simple file revert)

## Monitoring
- **Success Indicators**: CIG commands execute without errors
- **Failure Indicators**: Permission errors persist or new errors appear
- **User Impact**: CIG system functionality restored

## Communication
- **Stakeholders**: Development team using CIG system
- **Message**: CIG commands now functional after permission fix
- **Channels**: Internal development updates

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero permission errors in CIG commands
- [ ] All context loading functionality preserved
- [ ] User workflow restored (cig-init → cig-new-task → cig-status)

## Post-Rollout Actions
- [ ] Update documentation with lessons learned
- [ ] Consider preventive measures for future command development
- [ ] Archive bugfix implementation guide
